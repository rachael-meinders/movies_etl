# Movies ETL

## Overview 
Amazing Prime is sponsoring a hackathon to identify rising and popular movies for its streaming platform. I have been tasked with cleaning and preparing the data sources from the hackathon from a dataset scraped from Wikipedia for all movies relased since 1990, as well as rating data from Movie Land website.

### Purpose
1. Extract the data from Wikipedia and Movie Land
2. Transform the data to one good, clean, complete data set
3. Load the data set into a SQL database

### Resources
- wikipedia-movies.json
- movies_metadata.csv
- ratings.csv

## Challenge Overview
I have been further challenged to refactor the original data to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
